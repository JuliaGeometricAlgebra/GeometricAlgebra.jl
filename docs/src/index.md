# GeometricAlgebra.jl

[GeometricAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometricAlgebra/GeometricAlgebra.jl.git)
defines a collection of abstract types and operations intended to serve as a common
interface for geometric algebra packages. Our aim is to promote consistency across
geometric algebra implementations that may be designed to serve different purposes and
audiences.
